### About the Dataset.
This is a accident dataset which covers 49 states of the United States.The data is collected from February 2016 to March 2019, using several data providers, including two APIs which provide streaming traffic event data. These APIs broadcast traffic events captured by a variety of entities, such as the US and state departments of transportation, law enforcement agencies, traffic cameras, and traffic sensors within the road-networks. Currently, there are about 2.25 million accident records in this dataset. Check here to learn more about this dataset.

Exploratory Data analysis has been performed on the dataset.

The predictions have been performed on the state of California and San Francisco County.
